# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones. 

This project was assigned to Mike Watt during the Yandex Practicum and was completed as part of the program. The project practices HTML, CSS Grid, and the BEM methodology.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Good luck and have fun!
